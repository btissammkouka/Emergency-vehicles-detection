# 🚨 Emergency Vehicle Detection System

This project implements a real-time system to **detect Morrocan emergency vehicles** (ambulances, fire trucks, police cars) using computer vision. The goal is to support smart traffic light systems and urban mobility planning by **giving priority to emergency vehicles**.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Real-time emergency vehicle detection from video camera
- 🎯 YOLO-based object detection model
- 🧠  Integration with traffic light controller for smart routing when an emergency vehicle is detected
- 🖥️ Built using Python, OpenCV, and YOLO-v8, arduino for embedded system

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Smart traffic light systems
- Urban emergency management
- Intelligent transportation systems
- Safety and surveillance
